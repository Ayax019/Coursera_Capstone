Introduction/Business Problem

Problem
I will start with the following question, will there be any pattern or some 
condition or combination of factors that define if a car accident only affects 
the car as such or if the accident is of such severity that it affects the person?

Stakeholders
From my point of view, finding this finding would be very useful to auto insurers, 
first aid teams, social security authorities or even the government of the region.
